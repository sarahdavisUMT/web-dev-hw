  <h1>Sarah Davis</h1>
  <h2>The Highwayman</h2>
  <h3>Alfred Noyes</h3>

<hr />

<pre>The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees.
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas.
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor,
And the highwayman came riding—
         Riding—riding—
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door.</pre>
