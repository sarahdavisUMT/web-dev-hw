# Assignment 2

A version control system allows for the user to see all saved versions of a file and view all edits and changes made by the user or other collaborators. We are using one in this class so we can see all the changes we made along the way during this course.

Here are my [responses](./responses.txt).

## Work Cycle
I struggled a little bit with this cycle, purely because of my lack of prior web development experience, but I made it through!
- I watched all of the resource material on the course site.
- I took the optional quizzes to make sure I understood before trying the work.
- I took my time and followed the instructions exactly.
