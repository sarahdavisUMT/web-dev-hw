# Technical Report

I find this class very interesting, I just wish I had been able to take more time to work on it this week!

I am excited to learn how to add animations and more active, moving pieces.

I had very limited time, so I can't honestly speak too much about my work cycle. I am excited to continue working on it and have a revision ready.
