<h1>About Me</h1>
<p id="introduction">
  A few years after high school, my sister-in-law talked me into going to nail school. It was a bit of an impulsive decision, but I decided to go. I learned a lot there, I learned a valuable cosmetic skill, and I had a lot of fun doing it.
</p>

<p id="nail-design">I had the most fun creating designs and hand painting art on top of the acrylic nails. My favorite ones I ever did were inspired by <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.

<p id="choose">I chose to share this because it is a unique skill that I have and an interesting one to share. It can be difficult and is definitely time-consuming for the beginner, but it is fun and when done right, can last for a few weeks at a time.
